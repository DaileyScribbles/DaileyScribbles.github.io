Welcome to Dailey Scribbles!

I am Dailey and I share a scribble every day!


I was always interested in drawing and art as a child. I would spend my time drawing cars and mechanical shapes. But as I got older, studying and jobs seemed to get in the way, I found that I had less and less time to devote to drawing. My creative outlet ended up being in the form of doodling in the margin of my revision notes or a few scribbles during a work meeting.

The day I decided to start this challenge, the day I am actually writing this, I have been putting other aspects of my life as priority over me having a creative outlet of drawing and painting. I would say to myself that this task needs doing on this weekend or after work, that is why I should not take time to draw now. Once this task is out of the way, I can make a specific time, sit down, and draw then. Needless to say, this process repeated, and I would not make time.

The day I decided to start this challenge, the day I am actually writing this, today, I watched a Ted talk which was about a drawing day.

I pondered this, I thought, a drawing a day, that would not need any specific minimum time commitment. It could be a quick doodle, or more if I wanted it to be.

This would be a good way of me having a project as my creative outlet. I decided to document my journey and progress my sharing my story, and my doodles.

On this day, I started a "dailey scribbles".

I would be extremely grateful if you could provide me with feedback as I hope to improve as an illustrator.
